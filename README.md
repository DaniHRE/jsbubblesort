# **What's is? ðŸ“š**

Bubble Sort is the _simplest_ sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in _wrong order_.

## **Example ðŸ§©**

If the objective is values â€‹â€‹in crecent form, then the current position is exchanged with the next position, and if the current position is greater than the larger position, the values â€‹â€‹at that position are exchanged. Otherwise, the exchange is not performed, only the next pair of comparisons is carried out.
